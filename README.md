WEEK THREE AND FOUR:
the company assigned us some assignments which we have to solve in 15 days.
ASSIGNMENT 1:
Fish Dataset :
The dataset consists of 7 records (Species, Weight, Length1, Length2, Length3, Height, Width) with common different fish species which are available in the market. by analyzing this data, we can predict the estimated weight of fish. using this dataset we applied the concepts of data processing, data visualization, data analysis, and retrieved r2 score.
ASSIGNMENT 2:
Vehicle Dataset:
This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
using this dataset we applied the concepts of data processing, data visualization, data analysis, and retrieved r2 score.
